> ## ProTips:
> 
> According to [this guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/), this file is supposed to have the following guidelines:
>
> * Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
> * Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
> * Community and behavioral expectations.
>
> Since now GitHub has [launched a feature](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) supporting [template for Pull Requests](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and [Issues](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the two first items were moved to their own file.

> **Important:** Despite this first comment block (_ProTips_), all commented blocks below are examples that could be used in a real-world project.

# How to contribute

On the first paragraph, take some lines to thank your future contributors. It motivates people and makes you more human.

Expose your project guidelines about how to contribute to it. Offer resources that people could use to discuss changes they wish to make, ask questions and talk about how they could help (and what needs their help). How they can reach you or the team behind this? Some examples:

* IRC channel
* Skype
* Mailing list
* Some Project Management tool. 

_Now this is a good time to remind people to follow some rules and to be polite while contributing:_

> Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Getting started

Here you should address guidelines about future functionalities, milestone labels, bugs and unlisted features, issued assignments, etc. Since now we have an `Issue` and a `Pull Request` template, you can reference them directly:

> For further guidance about getting started, please refer to the related links:

* [Pull Request Guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* [Issues Guidelines](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

It's important people know the rules for contributing in the project. It's irritating for people trying to help when they are pushed back because they didn't follow some process that they didn't know existed. This file is the place for these processes and it will lower the barrier to entry for contribution.

## Coding conventions

Code should be optimized for readability. Attach some custom style guide or reference some:

> Ir order to sanitize coding standards, please follow [this style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Code of Conduct

This section should explicitly state that we will not discriminate against people on any grounds other than their code contributions, and make clear that behaviour that would be harmful to other people that may wish to contribute is not acceptable. This gives clear authority to remove people who are causing problems, and also sets a clear tone of inclusion. 

We achieve this by including a code of conduct like [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) or as a seperate `code_of_conduct` file. [See this example](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).
