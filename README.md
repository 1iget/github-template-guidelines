## Installing

Clone this project and name it accordingly:

```
git clone git@github.com:cez-aug/github-project-boilerplate.git MY-PROJECT-NAME && cd MY-PROJECT-NAME

```

# Getting Started 

This project is a boilerplate containing pre-build templates with resumed guidelines for `README`, `CONTRIBUTING` and `CHANGELOG` files. It also includes `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` which are now [allowed by GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates), all of them filled under `.github/` folder. 

This README itself is a fork of the [README boilerplate]() file and targets to offer a minimum explanation about this project purpose and usage. 

## Usage 

1. `Clone` or `fork` this project.
2. Remove this file `rm README.md`.
3. Move the `README` boilerplate file located under `.github/` to the main directory `mv .github/README.md .`. The `.github/` is a hidden folder [created with the new GitHub's feature](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) to avoid verbose on your project. However, the `README` file must be in your project's root folder.
4. Follow the basic usage guidelines in each file or make it your way. *The world is yours*.
