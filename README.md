# Getting Started 

This project is a boilerplate containing pre-build templates with resumed guidelines for README, CONTRIBUTING and CHANGELOG files, all of them filled under `template-files/`.

2. Remove this file `rm README.md`.
3. Move the desired template files under `template-files/` to the main directory and remove the unnecessary folder: `mv template-files/* . && rmdir template-files/`
4. Now that you eliminated the garbage and have the files ready: start editing and have fun! :dancers:
